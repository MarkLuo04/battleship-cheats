# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project: Battleship Cheats

In our project, we aim to model the two-player strategy board game, Battleship, and solve a way to cheat, if we were allowed to move some of the ships. A fleet of ships is placed onto a grid. To steer our project in a unique direction, we will explore how players can shift their ships in response to incoming shots to avoid being hit. It is considered a miss if the opponent incorrectly targets a position without a ship, or if the player successfully shifts their ship out of harmâ€™s way. A shot is a hit if the opponent correctly identifies the location of a ship, and the player has no option to move their ship to avoid the hit. Our model will use logical propositions and constraints to represent the game board, ship placements and shifts, and shots fired systematically.

## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: General wrapper script that you can choose to use or not. Only requirement is that you implement the one function inside of there for the auto-checks.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
